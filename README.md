# census_getter
Census getter is tool to get Census 5-year ACS data using an expression file. The expression file provides information to the program- each row specifies information about which variables should be retrieved and how they should be aggregated. Currently, this tool returns data at the block group level- data at the tract level is apportioned to the block group either by total households or total population, which is also specified in the expresson file. Please see example_psrc/configs/census_getter_expressions to see how this file is set up. Also see example_psrc/configs/settings.yml for how to specify geographic area and census year.
